# Quark-Deconfinement-and-Lattice-QCD

This project investigates the confinementâ€“deconfinement phase transition in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), focusing on the conditions under which quarks become
deconfined at high temperatures. A simplified model of the strong interaction is implemented using Monte Carlo simulations within the framework of lattice QCD. The study
begins with pure gluodynamics and examines how to incorporate quarks to explore the
emergence of free quarks. Simulations are conducted using an SU(2) gauge group to
represent a two color theory, serving as a building block to the full SU(3) theory. Observables such as the average plaquette and the Polyakov loop are used to identify
the critical temperature and examine the conditions under which this phase transition
occurs. The results provide insight into the workings of deconfinement and lay the
groundwork for future studies involving more realistic gauge groups and dynamical
fermions.
